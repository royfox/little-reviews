  This is a movie about a police narcotics unit who find $20m of drug money hidden in a wall. But are some of them trying to steal it? 
  
  The start was a bit disjointed as it tries to introduce all the characters all at once, but once they stumbled upon that $20m in cash the film settled into a decent rhythm. There was some tension, it was engaging. That suspense kinda fell away though as the movie went on, not least because all the twists were fairly bluntly given away well in advance. When they finally got to what I assume was supposed to be the shocking big reveal, it didn't land because nothing about it was surprising at all. The movie then finished with half an hour of fairly boring action. I don't know if I didn't like the way the climactic chase was filmed (fast cutting, hard to follow), or if I'd just lost interest in the outcome by that point. But the final act didn't work for me. I also have some gripes about the aesthetic - surely this movie needed something a bit more realistic and grittier, rather than this orange/teal colour grade and hyperreal vibe. 
  
  Didn't hate it, won't remember it.
