    Perhaps a bit silly in places but I enjoyed it. Sometimes I find you can take against a movie for whatever reason, and from then on every nonsensical thing a character will stick out like a sore thumb and annoy the hell out of you. But sometimes you seem to just roll with a movie, and the plot holes don't seem to bother you. For me this film stayed on the right side of that line, I was willing to forgive the implausible moments. There's some action, some moral dilemmas, some good performances. I quite liked it.

    There's one particularly interesting music choice in the movie, which was to use a jazzy folk piece in a lot of the key moments (the main cue is Stony Gate 2, which is a more cinematic version of Stony Gate by Fergus McCreadie - the music was striking enough that I whipped out Shazam at the time to find out what it was). I thought it worked great, that music might be the thing I remember most about the movie.
