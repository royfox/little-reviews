  This is a movie about a police unit who find $20m of drug money hidden in a wall. It's... fine? Didn't hate it, won't remember it. 
  
  There film settled into a decent rhythm in the second act. There was some tension. But the suspense fell away though as the movie went on. The "whodunnit" element was given away well in advance, there were so many unsubtle clues, but when they got to the big reveal, it seemed like we were meant to be surprised by it? Maybe this is one of those films where they assume everyone on streaming isn't really paying attention. Subtle it was not. 
  
  The final act didn't work for me. I don't know if I didn't like the way the climactic chase was filmed (fast cutting, hard to follow), or if I'd just lost interest in the outcome by that point.
  
  A final nit about the aesthetic - surely this movie needed something more realistic and grittier, rather than this orange/teal colour grade and hyperreal vibe.
