  This is a movie about some police who find a load of drug money. I found the start a bit disjointed, but once they found $20m in cash and started to hint at stealing it, the film settled into a decent rhythm, and was reasonably tense and engaging. That suspense kinda fell away for me though - all the twists were completely telegraphed well in advance, and when they finally got to what I assume was supposed to be a big reveal that was surprising for the audience, it didn't really land for me because there were no surprises there at all (to the point where they must have known that was exactly what they were doing). The movie then finished with half an hour of fairly boring action, lots of fast cuts and I wasn't really invested in the chase by that point anyway. Didn't hate it, won't remember it.
