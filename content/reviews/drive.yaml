    Loved the movie but I didn't take to the book. It's very short, if it was much longer I would have given up on it.

    It's told in a non-linear way, and it's very possible I missed some things in the early part of the book that led to me losing touch with it later on. I'd have to re-read it to give a really fair assessment of the book. I'll probably never bother though.
