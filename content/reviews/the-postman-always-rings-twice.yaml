  A very short book! It gets an extra star just for that. I like the prose, it's snappy, so there's a decent amount of plot in 122 pages. It doesn't really read like a book that's nearly 100 years old. I suppose in a way it's a love story about two broken people, but there's also lots of murderous noir shenanigans. The narrator's perspective is quite fun, he's telling his own story and probably thinks he's been hard done by in all this, but over time just reveals that he's actually a bit of an idiot (it was funny how the amateurish murder plot was immediately rumbled by the police, albeit that a lawyer managed to get him off because he was able to do a deal with the insurance companies that the police were relying on for their evidence - one bit that did make the book seem from a bygone age).
