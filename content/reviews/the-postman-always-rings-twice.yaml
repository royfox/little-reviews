    A very short book! It gets an extra star just for that.

    I like the prose, it's snappy, so there's a decent amount of plot in 122 pages.

    It doesn't come across like a book that's nearly 100 years old. The prose is easy to read, and you can empathise with the characters (violence and murderous shenanigans notwithstanding), they don't seem like characters from a distant past. You could set a version of this story in the modern day without needing to change much at all about the plot (the one exception being that a lawyer was able to get someone off a murder charge by doing a deal with the insurance companies that the police were relying on for their evidence).

    It was pretty funny how a carefully plotted but very amateurish murder plot was immediately rumbled by the police, the narrator is not as smart as he thinks he is.
