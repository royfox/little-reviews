  I love the sound of this record, it’s just a lovely vibe. It breezes along, it sets the mood. There’s an article by the producers in Sound on sound, and mix engineer Charlie Holmes says “When working on Olivia’s record, she said, ‘I want it to sound like a warm hug all the time.’”. I think they achieved that.
  
  It’s more of a background vibe for me though. Even after a few playthroughs I can’t remember most of the songs (apart from Man I Need, of course, which is obviously a banger). “The Art of Loving is, in all sincerity, a perfect album to cook or clean to.”, say Pitchfork, which is probably where I’m at too. I find myself wanting to know how they produced it, how they made this open and naturalistic sound and arrangements that suits her voice so well. But when the album is finished playing I can’t really remember too much else about it, other than that I enjoyed having it on. Perhaps a few more risks and experiments would help, something to give it a bit more edge for me latch on to. But then, of course, it might not be the warm hug that it is.
