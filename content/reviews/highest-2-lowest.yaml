  I enjoyed this film, so it was funny to see afterwards that some people absolutely hated it. I found a Reddit thread about the film that was nothing but negativity, and when they pointed out all these plot holes, I was like "well, now you mention it, that was a bit silly". Sometimes I find you can take against a movie for whatever reason, and from then on every nonsensical thing a character will stick out like a sore thumb and annoy the hell out of you. But sometimes you seem to just roll with a movie, and the plot holes don't seem to bother you. For me this film stayed on the right side of that line, I was willing to forgive the implausible moments. There's some action, some moral dilemmas, some good performances. I quite liked it. 
  
  The thing I remember about it most though will probably be some of the music. There's one particularly interesting choice in this movie, which was to use a kind of slightly jazzy folk piece in a lot of the key moments (the main cue is Stony Gate 2, which is a more cinematic version of Stony Gate by Fergus McCreadie - the music was striking enough that I whipped out Shazam at the time to find out what it was). That was an unconventional choice but I thought it really worked - it's propulsive, it's got the simplicity and repetition of folk music, but also a little jazzy edge that suits that moment in the movie.
