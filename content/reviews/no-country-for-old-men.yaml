  The first Cormac McCarthy book I've read. It's very similar to the movie, which lessens the suspense a bit if you've seen the movie, all the major plot points are the same (even the fact that Moss is killed off-screen, or off-page). That makes it a bit hard to form a fresh opinion about the book, and probably also meant I speed read it a bit and missed some of the subtlety of the book. So I liked the book, but that might be partly because I like the film. 
  
  It's hard not to comment on the style of the prose, quite minimalist, almost like a screenplay at times, and hardly any punctuation (which I mostly don't mind, although it still the missing apostrophe in words like dont and cant looked weird to me every time). There are also these injections/introspections from the Sheriff periodically, a couple of pages in italics each time. They were a bit of a slog and I pretty much gave up on them half-way through the book.
