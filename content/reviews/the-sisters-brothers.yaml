  This was worth reading, even if I ultimately wasn't completely invested in the story. The narrator Eli is an interesting character to listen to, he's simple-minded but insightful; empathetic and thoughtful yet also violent. For a while it's fun to go on an odyssey with him and his brother (and their relationship is very nicely drawn), and as they trot across The West and meet a cast of characters along the way, and a lot of the prose flows beautifully, and both our characters and the story keep moving. It all stalled for me when they arrived at their destination though – in the third act and the last third of the book, it started to drag and I realised I actually wasn’t very invested in the outcome and what actually happened to these characters. The characters stopped moving, the story stopped moving. That section felt like it was from a different book - rather than a quirky travel story, we ended up in a more stodgy allegory (the characters were trying to use some chemical to help them find gold even though the chemical was killing them). The denouement after that was nicely done though (and much faster than everything that led up to it).
