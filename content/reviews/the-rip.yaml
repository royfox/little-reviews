    It's fine. Didn't hate it, won't remember it.

    It's not subtle at all, the twist is revealed extremely obviously in advance but then presented like it's meant to be a big surprise.

    The third act was boring, not sure if it was the way it was cut together, or if I'd just lost interest by then.

    Surely this movie needed a realistic and gritty aesthetic, rather than the stereotypical orange/teal colour grade and hyperreal vibe.
