  There's a lovely vibe to this album, it breezes along, it sets the mood. There’s an article by the producers in Sound on sound, and mix engineer Charlie Holmes says “When working on Olivia’s record, she said, ‘I want it to sound like a warm hug all the time.’”.
  
  That said, it doesn't stick with me - “The Art of Loving is, in all sincerity", say Pitchfork "a perfect album to cook or clean to." The production is lovely, poppy yet naturalistic. Perhaps a few more risks and experiments would help, something to give it a bit more edge to latch on to. But then I suppose it might not be the warm hug that it is.
