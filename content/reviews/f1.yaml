    It's the modern big budget action movie in a nutshell – it's very slick and completely forgettable. You aren't bored when it's on, but you can't remember a thing about it a week later.

    The plot actually almost feels like a satire on F1, with drivers completely relying on safety cars and red flags for any actual jeopardy.

    The plot of the movie is that a terrible team with no points at all in the first half of the season needs to win a race in the second half of the season to save the team. I'm not the biggest F1 fan but that seems a laughably unrealistic goal, so if that's the setup, you have no choice but to fill the movie with a load of nonsense in order to achieve it.

    I did like the music though.
