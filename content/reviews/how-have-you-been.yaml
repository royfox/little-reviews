    A German band that sounds strangely like a British Indie band from about 2010.

    I can't quite place what it reminds me of – maybe some combination of Everything Everything, Bastille, Foals, Two Door Cinema Club, The Kooks, The Vaccines, The Walkmen.

    Some good moments, can easily imagine some of these songs on UK radio or at a festival.

    Might add a couple of songs to a playlist, probably won't keep playing the album, just not quite my thing.
