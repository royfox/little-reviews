  So here is a record that sounds like an English band playing festival-friendly indie-rock from sometime around the year 2010. It turns out it’s actually a record from a German band in 2024. I mean, if you listen to the vocal at the start of Pink Skies I feel like you could almost start to make educated guesses about exactly which part of England the singer is from. I can easily imagine this music in a Radio 1 playlist (that is, if they still play indie music on Radio 1, I don’t know, I’m too old for that these days). 
  
  The sound of this album reminds me of something, a band or album that I can’t quite place – maybe some combination of Everything Everything, Bastille, Foals, Two Door Cinema Club, The Kooks, The Vaccines or The Walkmen (if you’ve even seen that old tweet “Dudes can literally just sit around and name old sports players and just have the best time”, this is that but for indie bands). None of those are right but you get the idea. 
  
  There are a few quite catchy songs here, I quite like the vibe, and I do kinda find myself singing along here and there. I mean, it’s maybe a little poppy for my taste overall, and I doubt it will survive in my rotation. For me perhaps we’re more at the level of “add a couple of their best songs to a playlist” rather than “listen to the whole album all the way through”.  It’s quite funny that when I was looking for more info about the band, I discovered that a lot of their older fans seem to hate this album, and think they’ve sold out – longtime fans of a band obviously come to an album with a different expectation to someone like me who only just heard of them for the first time. "Painfully generic", says one. An "unrecognizable blop of indie cliches", says another. A bit harsh.
