    "The Art of Loving is, in all sincerity, a perfect album to cook or clean to", say Pitchfork, and I think I agree, it's very good background music, it sets a lovely mood, but apart from "Man I Need", I don't remember it when it's finished

    There’s an article by the producers in Sound on sound, and mix engineer Charlie Holmes says “When working on Olivia’s record, she said, ‘I want it to sound like a warm hug all the time.’”. That's a good description, it is a warm hug.

    The production is great (which is why I paid for that article in Sound on sound, to see what I could find out about how they did it!).
