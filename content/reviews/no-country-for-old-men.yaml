    My first Cormac McCarthy book.
  - |
    The plot is very very similar to the movie, there are subtle character difference but pretty much all the major plot points are the same (even the fact that Moss is killed off-screen, or off-page).

    I maybe speed read it a bit and missed some of the subtlety of the book, because I already knew what was going to happen from the film. So I liked the book, but that might be partly because I like the film.
  - |
    The prose is quite minimalist, almost like a screenplay at times, and hardly any punctuation (which I mostly didn't mind, although it still the missing apostrophe in words like dont and cant looked weird to me every time).

    There are also these injections/introspections from the Sheriff periodically, a couple of pages in italics each time. They were a bit of a slog and I pretty much gave up on them half-way through the book.
